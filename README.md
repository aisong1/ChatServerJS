# ChatServerJS

A simple chat server where users can communicate with other users. Announces when a user enters and leaves, and keeps an updated count of how many users are in the chat.

Built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Heroku. 

The setup code for this project comes from server.js' [chat tutorial](https://serverjs.io/tutorials/chat/); the rest of the code is my own.

# Project Status

Completed. Fully running and available as of June 7th, 2020.

Possible future update would be to implement a 'users list' where other users can see who else is in the chat.

# Setup and Installation

# Reflection. 

I dove into this project having just finished an online course on JavaScript. In light of the ongoing global pandemic, I wanted to build an application that emphasized communication between two parties. Creating a chat server taught me more about JS and a ton about WebSockets. It also acted as a refresher for Heroku and version control.
